Priority list Rhythms
---------------------

1. Resize states
	? What does this mean
	In this position on the roadmap we want to have decent state control
	We want to get rid of the stupid state menu
	We need a proper state toolbar
	a. Length of the state
	b. Moving the state around
	c. Selecting and moving multiple states
	

2. State categories
	Mainly a visual
	Implement as a tag system (custom overrides in StateDrawer, basic overrides in settings)
	a. Pre-State
	b. Input State
		This is a state that will listen to input
	c. Event State
	d. Base State
		These are tags, we should be able to add other tags in the Settings
		These have different stateDrawer, just to differentiate them 
		We should be able to easily expand and add tags with custom drawers as we go

3. Custom editor for StateActions
	We should have access to state action editor which allows us to override the look of a state action

4. RhythmComponent with RhythmPatterns
	Instead of only having a rhtyhm component with every beat a tick, we should be able to assign a pattern on when the event is broadcasted.
	Basically have a visual indicator like this: [-][-][-][-]|[-][-][-][-] and when we fill it in it could look like this: [-][x][x][-]|[x][-][-][x],
	Everytime a beat is hit with a 'x' we broadcast the event

5. Templates
	Same as playmaker, being able to save away entire rhythm sequences, assign them to components, have a list of variables exposed in the prefab editor. When editing them all of the prefabs have the updated sequence

6. GroupedStates 
	Basically a prefab of states that you can save and place wherever you want. Basically a minor version of the template functionality
	Instead of allowing it be a sequence, it's a group of states which you can place and edit on its own

7. Run & Debug functionality
	a. Error display
	b. Breakpoints

8. UI/UX improvements

9. Expand library of actions 
	a. Track control (being able to enable/disable tracks)
