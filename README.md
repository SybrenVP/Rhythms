# Rhythms
Custom editor which helps creating rhythm games. 


Rhythms is used to make rhythm games. It provides an editor in which you can edit a sequence which will play on the music. 
A Sequence consists of Tracks. These Tracks contain States which are placed per Beat. These States will then trigger Actions based on their position in the sequence. 

Basically combining the Finite State Machine concept with Rhythm based sequencing in a custom editor.
