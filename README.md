# Rhythms
Custom editor which helps creating rhythm games. 


Rhythms provides an editor in which you can edit a Sequence.
A Sequence consists of Tracks. These Tracks contain States which are placed per Beat. These States will then trigger Actions based on their position in the sequence. 
So a Sequence is actually a song on which actions are placed to create behaviours which trigger on the beat during a rhythmic song. 

Basically combining the Finite State Machine concept with Rhythm based sequencing in a custom editor.
