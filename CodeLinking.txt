How the call and response system will work in code?

Sequence will send out Call event to any listeners
	Listeners could range from instantiation to animation triggers or sound effects etc

Upon receiving the call event, a listener could also ensure the response setup completes.
	EX: Maybe an instantiation needs to happen before the response can be called

A response will almost in all cases be an input event (I can't actually think of any other)

The object will wait for the correct input event, after the event came through it will check if it came in on time. 

If the event doesn't come in before the first beat after the last beat of the response then it will be dismissed. 

Responses with more than 1 beat in length will wait for a start and end. (could be used for performing an input over a set amount of beats)
